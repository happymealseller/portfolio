    paragraph: `Turns out, I was able to make this my full time job for 2 years, but not without its ups and downs.\n\nAt first everything was done manually and I could not keep up with the demand. I had to research android virtual machines to train multiple characters in parallel, telegram bots to organize these 20 player instances as well as look for forums to purchase phone verified emails to create more game accounts.\n\nAs operations scaled, I even acquired custom scripts that could automate processes on my virtual machines.`,

    paragraph: `Working with tools I barely understood on a daily basis gave me insight into the importance of learning to code. Its applications were boundless and the impact it could potentially make was significant.\n\nFast foward to late 2021, while researching articles on what programming language to learn, I stumbled upon Rocket Academy's free basic programming course. The instructors there gave me a clearer idea of programming in general, which inspired me to pursue it on a full-time basis.\n\nSo that's how and why I decided to learn to code!`,
